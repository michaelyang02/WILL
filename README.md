# WILL

This is the reverse engineering project of a popular game called WILL: A Wonderful World that allows the player to rearrange text blocks in order to change the outcome of stories through a dozen characters' timeline interweaving with each other. It is written in C# using the Unity Engine that encapsulates the core visual and logic mechanisms of the game from the game menu to character timeline and text rearrangment.
